### Hello! I'm a teacher looking to transition back into the data analytics field. 
### Feel free to check out my  projects below: 

## Divvy Bike Share Google Analytics Capstone Project
● Analyzed bike share data to determine how to convert casual riders into members. Used R to clean and transform the data, and Tableau to create dashboards to allow users to explore the visualized data.

## World Health Organization COVID Data Project
●	Analyzed data from the world health organization to visualize trends in COVID infections and vaccinations. Used Excel to format the data, created a database with Microsoft SQL SMS. I used MySQL to explore and transform the data, and Tableau to visualize the data.

## Stock Market Linear Regression Project
●	Used linear regression to develop models to predict the most profitable stocks in the S&P 500 using Python. Used data scraping techniques to retrieve data from Yahoo Finance. 

## Movie Correlation Project
●	Used Python with Pandas and NumPy to find statistical correlations between different variables in movie box office revenue data, and visualized these correlations with Seaborn.

## Nashville House Data Cleaning Project
