### Hello! After three years as a teacher, I'm looking to transition into the data analytics field. My journey in data analytics began with my B.A. in Computer Science from Vassar College, where I took a wide range of courses from Data Mining to Various Computer Modeling Courses. Since then, I've used data anaysis in both my daily life and in my job as a teacher. 


### Feel free to check out my projects below: 

## Divvy Bike Share Google Analytics Capstone Project
● Analyzed bike share data to determine how to convert casual riders into members. Used R to clean and transform the data, and Tableau to create dashboards to allow users to explore the visualized data.

## World Health Organization COVID Data Project
●	Analyzed data from the world health organization to visualize trends in COVID infections and vaccinations. Used Excel to format the data, created a database with Microsoft SQL SMS. I used MySQL to explore and transform the data, and Tableau to visualize the data.

## Stock Market Linear Regression Project
●	Used linear regression to develop models to predict the most profitable stocks in the S&P 500 using Python. Used data scraping techniques to retrieve data from Yahoo Finance. 

## Movie Correlation Project
●	Used Python with Pandas and NumPy to find statistical correlations between different variables in movie box office revenue data, and visualized these correlations with Seaborn.

## Nashville House Data Cleaning Project
●	Used SQL to clean and transform a dataset on Housing purchases in Nashville.

## CO2 Emissions Visualization Project
●	Used Tableau to visualize Global CO2 emissions by country.
