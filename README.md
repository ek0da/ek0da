Used R to [clean and transform the data](https://github.com/ek0da/Portfolio/blob/main/Case_Study_Bike_Data/Divvy%20Bike%20Case%20Study%20Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Transformation.ipynb), and Tableau to create dashboards to allow users to [explore the visualized data](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dakota.ewing/viz/DivvyBikeRideCaseStudy/DivvyBikeShareAnalysis).

## World Health Organization COVID Data Project
●	Analyzed data from the world health organization to visualize trends in COVID infections and vaccinations. Used Excel to format the data, created a database with Microsoft SQL SMS. I used MySQL to [explore and transform the data](https://github.com/ek0da/Portfolio/blob/main/Micro%20Projects/COVID%20Data%20Transformation%20Project.sql), and Tableau [to visualize the data](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dakota.ewing/viz/COVIDDashboard_16564722380540/Sheet3).
